# C++ Agent Template

THUAI7 agent template in C++

## Usage

### Prerequisites

Before building the project, you need to install [XMake](https://xmake.io) first. Of course, a C++ compiler is also required.

### Build

Run the following code to configure the project:

```bash
xmake f -m debug
```

Or in release mode:

```bash
xmake f -m release
```

Then build the project:

```bash
xmake
```

### Write Your Code

You can write your code in `logic.cc`. For experienced developers, you can also modify any other files in the project.

### Run

If you modify the code in `main.cc`, this section may be invalid.

Run the following command to start the agent:

```bash
./agent --server <server> --token <token>
```

- `<server>`: The server address of the game. (Default: `ws://localhost:14514`)
- `<token>`: The token of the agent. (Default: `1919810`)

For example:

```bash
./agent --server ws://localhost:14514 --token 1919810
```
